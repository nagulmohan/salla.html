         <h3>History of Saala Gang

            Every legend have a starting, and ours start in the streets of Tirunelveli, the birth place of Saala ‚Äì a name that shakes the ground. Born and growed up in Tirunelveli, Saala didn‚Äôt just live life; he rulled it. But fate have bigger plans for him. Now, he is living in Amarthur and studying in Mega Strict Engineering College, Sivakasi.
            
            They says, ‚ÄúPowerfull people come from powerfull places.‚Äù But Saala proved ‚ÄúPowerfull people make places powerfull!‚Äù With a history full of chaos and domminance, he have 500 cases and a name nobody dare to mess with. From the streets of Tirunelveli to the gates of Ghastrick, Saala's name echos with power, respect, and a little of mischife.
